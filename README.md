# Watershed Delineation using PCRaster Python
This project shows how to delineate a watershed using PCRaster Python. The study area of this personal project is the Ciliwung River Basin / DAS Ciliwung in Indonesia.
In this project, I used PCRaster and GDAL in Python, as well as the geospatial software, namely QGIS. The data sources utilized in this project are from the Indonesia Geospatial Information Agency (BIG) and OpenStreetMap.
The output of this project is to obtain a watershed or a catchment area and subsequently use it for further hydrological analysis.

Special thanks to Mr Hans van der Kwast, a senior lecturer from IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, for teaching Programming for Geospatial Hydrological Applications, a course of study offered by UNESCO in 2021, so I can apply the knowledge to this project.
